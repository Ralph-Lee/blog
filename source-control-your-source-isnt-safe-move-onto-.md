Hi, how are you doing? Have you heard the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics">Olympics are on this year</a>? A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_the_sheep">sheep was cloned</a>? The <a href="http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=unabomber">Unabomber was arrested</a>? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braveheart">Braveheart wins the Oscar for Best Picture</a>? <a href="http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9705/kasparov.vs.dblue/first.match/index.html">Deep Blue beats Kasparov for the first time</a>? Oh, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_SourceSafe">1996 called, it wants its version control system back</a>.
For the Microsoft oriented developer, it's historically been the <strike>safe</strike> easiest way to ensure that the results of your hard work aren't lost to the randomness of the world: Delete keys, hard drive crashes, power surges, etc. Pre .NET days, it was RIGHT ON THE DISC.

My first encounter with VSS was with the <a href="http://www.vbmigration.com/Images/Whitepapers/vb6ide.png">Visual Basic 6 environment</a>. Of course, the Visual C++ IDE had the plugin as well. Remember back in those days, there wasn't one unified IDE, as we have today with .NET. 

Move On!
There are lots of contemporary solutions out there.
