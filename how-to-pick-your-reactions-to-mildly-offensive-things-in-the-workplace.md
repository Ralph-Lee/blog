*This isn't about laying blame or shaming anyone. It's about choosing your reaction.*

I've noticed a handful of sexism-in-tech stories recently:

- Mar 2013 [Forking repos and dongle jokes at PyCon](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks/)
- Mar 2014 [Inside the GitHub scandal: is sexism part of the Valley's DNA?](http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/19/5526574/github-sexism-scandal-julie-ann-horvath)
- Aug 2014 [On sexual harassment in the tech industry](http://thenextweb.com/voice/2014/08/20/sexual-harrassment-tech-industry/)
- Aug 2014 [Sexism at a hackathon - "who are the hottest girls at the hackathon?"](https://medium.com/hackers-and-hacking/a-hacking-hiatus-4844ae073d4)

Another example landed in my inbox recently, and I had the opportunity to **choose how I reacted** to something I found mildly offensive at work.  

This email was addressed to a group of software developers, all whom are male, in a business setting.
 
So immediately I felt we're going to be **talking about women**. With the subject line, the premise is set that women should be 'picked', [as if waiting to be chosen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binders_full_of_women).  It basically contained a [hot/crazy scale](http://i.imgur.com/GcL7FpD.jpg), and the attributes of women that fall in those zones. 

I wouldn't go so far as to call the content [misogynistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogeny), but certainly has sexist overtones and definitely objectifies women to be judged on a scale with 2 metrics - hot and crazy. I see that the video linked was labeled as comedic and tried to be funny, but I found that it failed in that. Some things just aren't funny.

My first reaction was to feel bad. I'm engaged as a viewer in something I find wrong. My second thought was that the content sends a bad message to our daughters and young women, primarily. The message is: **women fall onto a scale that men get to judge you on** and laugh about. I picked up on it as I'm in the midst of raising a daughter, and see the incredible challenges ahead: media perception, body image issues everywhere, etc.  

The secondary implication I read for males is that it's OK to continue speaking about women like this. 

### How To Pick Your Reaction

What's the best way I could react to this kind of content? I first wanted to shout out how I felt how wrong this is and have my opinion heard. I want to voice my opinion on the topic, but not be a grand-stander. Speaking up for the things you believe in is a good thing, but you should be consider the environment and situation where you stage your reactions. Actions lead to reactions, which can have further reactions.

I had to pause and ask myself: ***what are my goals in responding*?**  I landed on the goals of: don't embarrass anyone, and voice my opinion. It's important to point out bad behaviour and actions, rather than talking about people.

Here are a few approaches that I considered:

- **email reply-all** - this option seems a bit like grand-standing to me. Voicing or broadcasting your opinion loudly to everyone isn't my style. There's a high risk of embarrassment.

- **email reply-sender** - now you're having a conversation with the sender, but with the negative baggage that the email medium has. Tone and meaning is lost. It's on the record. 
 
- **talk to the person** - perhaps ask an innocuous question like: *Did you get any feedback on that email?* or flat-out speak your opinion like: *I thought that email was inappropriate*. I'd prefer this as it's in-person, and quick follow-up discussions can happen. There is a chance for embarrassment here, depending on the person. This comes with a cost.
 
- **write a blog post** - you can voice your opinion on your own time, in your own space. You write with the goal of not embarrassing anyone, and take the time to hone your thoughts.

- **take it to HR** - well, that's [one option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_option). 

#### Encouraging Diversity In Tech

It's no secret in the IT world that we're a largely male-populated industry. We should want to become more diverse in all kinds of way. We should all keep an open mind of the biases that the things we write and share with people contain. 

People make mistakes, and I believe the people involved in my personal example wouldn't have sent this if there were a female team member. I hope they wouldn't, anyway.

#### More Discussion On Diversity

Here's a snippet of a podcast episode with on women in tech.
