<!--{PublishedOn:"",Title:"Network Podcast App Review",Intro:"A new podcast app showed up for iPhone and iOS 7. I'm a big podcast listener. Here's my review of this app that's not yet a month old."}-->

The app description for [Network](http://networkapp.net) is

I think the developer hit the mark on this. There is absolutely ZERO configuration options, and I wish it would have those options available.

###Things I Do When Listening To Podcasts###

* skip forward and back
* refresh/reload my feed once a day; somet

###Things Network Gets Right###
* the play screen has a large scrubber button
* the overall look and feel is very iOS 7. It's refreshing. 
* there are no faux button/textlabels prevelent in iOS 7.
* the play screen is clean and uncluttered. The podcast shownotes
* chapters?
* the search and subscribe process was fantastic
* 

###Things I Wish They Did (Better)###

* support remote fast-forward from headphones (when the phone is both locked and unlocked)
* it's too easy to delete/mark a podcast as listened to. I've swiped an episode a handful of times by accident and have been forced to redownload it.
* give me visual cues showing me my navigation options.
* show cover art on the lock screen
* stop the bouncy effects - mostly noticeable for me between the play screen and the podcasts menu.
* larger cover art on the podcasts menu. The whitespace (or is it greyspace) on the side seems wasted.
