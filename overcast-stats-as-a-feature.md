<!--{Title:"Overcast: Stats As A Feature",Intro:"Podcast stats would be neat.", PublishedOn:"23-Jul-2014"}-->

This tweet got me thinking about data and stats.

Most users of [Overcast](http://overcast.fm), at least in its early days, are geeks, devs, etc. The Venn diagram of those people who like statistics is pretty well overlapping, I'd imagine. It'd be interesting to see how people, and I, are using the Overcast app and service. 

So Marco, can you take some time to build and update some stats? If not, would you be able to **make an anonymized data dump available**? I'd be willing to open source a web app on GitHub that could crunch as many stats as possible with the data given. Imagine something similar to [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](http://data.stackexchange.com/). 

It would be part trivia, part appreciation of Overcast's awesomeness. 

- number of episodes played. global and me.
- number of total podcast feeds index in the directory. global.
- top *n* subscribed podcasts. global.
- top *n* discovered podcast (those not currently subscribed, but found through the app by category or recommendation). global. 
- trend of number of minutes I play throughout the last 30 days. 
- which podcasts get played immediately, which languish? global and per-user.
- chart average listen daily duration. Trend the number of mins per day that Overcast was used. global and me.
- chart average listen time per hour. Same as above, but show the hour of the day.
