<!--{Title:"SkyDrive ", PublishedOn:"", Intro:"Everyone with an iOS device who cares about their photos should be backing up to iCloud AND another service."} -->

Today the Microsoft [SkyDrive team announced an updated version](http://blogs.windows.com/skydrive/b/skydrive/archive/2013/11/21/smile-camera-backup-has-arrived-on-the-new-skydrive-app-for-ios.aspx) of its [iPhone/iPad client](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skydrive/id477537958?mt=8). The big feature in this release is **Camera backup**. Your iOS camera roll can now be backed up to SkyDrive as you take pictures, and doesn't require the user to manually start the SkyDrive app to do so.
