Recently I found myself with the desire to start a new site. Rather than jumping into Visual Studio headfirst, I sat down and thought about how to start. 

* 
  **What technology** am I going to use? I always jump to this in the <em>Top 5 Things I Consider</em>, and I know it's not terribly important, and I know I should be thinking of other things. I always know the answer to this question, though.
* 
  **What features** should be on this site? Getting warmer. I typically write down the main <strike>features of the site</strike> goals of the user in point form. I am trying to train myself with this way of thinking: The site doesn't matter without the users wanting it to. Don't think about features, think about the user's goals.
* Monetize? Sure, in some small way, but that's not the main point of this new site, though. 
* 
  **How will the user see and contribute to the site?** Most important and relevant question. Piss off your users, or make it too complicated, or too lame, and you'll lose visitors.

The typical process I go through when faced with a new idea and a fresh start is to pull out the pad of paper and a pen. I am not a design genius, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/514083/why-is-good-ui-design-so-hard-for-some-developers">like most software developers</a>, but try my best to grok <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42793/gui-design-techniques-to-enhance-user-experience">user experience</a>. Sometimes I fall flat, sometimes I look back at previous work and throw up a little, and sometimes I am happy. Most of the time, I think I'm just lucky that I don't have too much scrutiny on my layouts and flow in my corporate line of business web apps.

I found this site recommended a few times on StackOverflow. It's almost self explanatory to how the site works.

###Draggy, Droppy, Stretchy, Copy###
There's a palette on the left, and a design surface on the right. Make a page for each of the user-goals. This isn't going to be set in stone, and things will change. Arrange the page elements on the design surface as you like.
Some neat features or user experiences I noticed:

* Labels/text scale nicely as you grab the corner and stretch. It (smartly) figures out when to bold and/or increase the size of your label. Other elements scale beautifully, especially those that are icons – calendar, pie chart, Twitter logo, etc.
* Double click any element to modify its text or contents – just as you'd expect.
* Configuring a Linkbar was easy. Mockingbird really nailed this element.
* You're able to associate links with pages that you've already defined. Just drag the Page on the left onto a form element.
* Elements are very generic – no Windows or Mac bias. It's just a rounded rectangle representing a button.
* There are lots of great elements that trigger new ideas. Seeing the Map and the Banner ad were great. Aside - tag clouds – meh... does anyone really like and use the tag cloud in the real world? I know StackOverflow has one, but I have never used it.
* The overall feel or experience is very much like a sketch. Positioning elements is made easier thanks to the horizontal and vertical alignment bars. Nice touch!

###Go Try It###
Just jump into mockingbird. You don't need to <a href="http://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/">create a mockingbird account</a> to try; only to save and retrieve your designs. It's free!
I wonder what platform mockingbird is running? Oh wait, it's called <a href="http://cappuccino.org/">Cappuccino</a>  (<a href="http://cappuccino.org/learn/">learn more</a>) and it's
  <blockquote>
  implemented using a new programming language called Objective-J, which is modelled after Objective-C and built entirely on top of JavaScript

Very cool user experience! Kudos to the <a href="http://gomockingbird.com/about/">mockingbird developers</a> Saikat and Sheena.
