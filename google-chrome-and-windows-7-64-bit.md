As of this post, Google Chrome doesn't work out of the box with Windows 7 64 bit. Funny, because that didn't happen with Vista 64. Oh well!
The funny part is Chrome's version of the [sad Mac](http://catesmusings.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/sadmac.gif). Well done, team!
The kicker here is that it DOES work, just that you have to set some command line options on the shortcut.
 
* Find the shortcut properties. 
* Modify the target: **chrome.exe --in-process-plugins**
* No quotes are needed here. 
* Save and relaunch. Voila!!
