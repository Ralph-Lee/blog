I'd like to share my favorite tech podcasts. These are in no particular order! You probably won't be surprised, it's the list of usual suspects circa 2008/2009. Click on each to go directly to the podcast's main page. You can find the RSS feed there!

###Scratched!###

* Alt.Net podcast - sorry guys, it was getting to sound a little too negative. I enjoyed the [Domain Driven Design](www.altnetpodcast.com/episodes/15-domain-driven-design) episode! 
* [Polymorphic podcast](polymorphicpodcast.com) - Craig sounds like a really nice guy, but there was a lull in the regularity of the podcasts, so I abandoned it. 
* [ASP.NET podcast](aspnetpodcast.com) - didn't tickle my fancy. It's not you, it's me. Serious! 

###Wish List###

* [Scott Gu](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu) -  Microsofties are blogging like crazy, I wonder if Scott has any time on his hands to do his own podcast. Ya right. He can be found as a guest here and there. 

What great developer podcasts or I.T. podcasts are out there that are missing from this list?!? Are YOU starting a podcast and wanting some listeners?
