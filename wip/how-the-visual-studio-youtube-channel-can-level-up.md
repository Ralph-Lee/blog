Here's what I would love to see from the Visual Studio YouTube channel.

### [https://www.youtube.com/user/VisualStudio](https://www.youtube.com/user/VisualStudio)

Solve the proble:

- who is the audience? Junior, mid, or senior devs? It's probably a 40/40/20 split.
- 

### Be Fresh ###

Show me common tasks. How can I use Visual Studio to

- start a new Node.js project with Visual Studio Code from scratch?
-  



### Connect With Your Audience ###

Make me feel like I'm part of the channel and 

Have weekly Hangouts. Take questions from the audience.
