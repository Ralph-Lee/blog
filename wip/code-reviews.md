I attended a user group recently, and a bunch of .NET developers were sharing stories about code reviews at their workplaces. The group had a few good experiences to share, but a lot of common complaints or shared negative experiences.
I've recently read articles and watched a few videos dealing with [approaches to improve your code reviews.](#better)

#### too little structure



#### no goals



#### chest thumping / territory marking



#### no follow-up



#### too infrequent



#### one-way conversations

1. Here's Enrico Campidoglio's presentation on code reviews at NDC Oslo 2104. I liked the mention of trust in the team.

1. [Erik Dietrich](https://twitter.com/daedtech) has a great post on code reviews- [Code Reviews Should Be about Incremental Improvement](http://www.daedtech.com/code-reviews-should-be-about-incremental-improvement). My takeaway was that you don't need to hit a home run on your code reviews. Review within your team more frequently, and you'll improve subtly in tiny steps.
