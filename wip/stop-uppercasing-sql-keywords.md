Why is it engrained as SQL writers that we uppercase SQL keywords in our DML and DDL statements?

For as long as I've been a developer, I've seen:

- my teams' Official Documented Recommended Best Practice Coding Standards document has included a section stating thou shalt uppercase your SQL keywords.
- [samples](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187731.aspx), [documentation](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/delete.html) from all the vendors
- developers have followed suit. [Questions and answers online](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/292026/is-there-a-good-reason-to-use-upper-case-for-sql-keywords) largely follow this practice, in my observation.
