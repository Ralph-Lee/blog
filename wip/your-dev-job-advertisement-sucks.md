Stack Overflow does a great job of showing you relevant jobs from its Stack Overflow Careers site.

This job advertistement has some problems, though.

### Juvenile Blowhard Job Title


*Chuck Norris*

This [meme started up in late 2005](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/people/chuck-norris). The application of it to developer in this advert is synonymous to that of ninja, guru, rock star, etc.

Here's [what developers think when you say "Rock Star"](http://blog.hirelite.com/what-developers-think-when-you-say-rock-star), "ninja", "guru", and other hyperbole.

> "rock star" communicates that you're not sure what you want. Or rather, you do know what you want, and what you want is a miracle worker. "Rock star" signals that you haven't thought enough about the role this developer will fill, leaving developers with a feeling that they'll be receiving ill-defined requirements, not enough time, or not enough resources to do their job (in addition to being overworked and underpaid).

It shows that the employer has a sense of humour, but distracts from a level of seriousness a candidate wants to see.
