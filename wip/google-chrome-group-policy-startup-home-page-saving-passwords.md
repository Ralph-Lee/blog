### Chrome in the Enterprise

Happy to see that Chrome is being *allowed* or blessed by the IT Overlords. They even allow Chrome to update itself! Amazing!
The issue is that the geniuses in IT think they know the best settings for everyone. [Mooooove!](http://i.imgur.com/L5iCone.jpg)

### That's Our Policy 

#### Pages

There's a Group Policy for Chrome's:

- startup pages
- bookmark bar
- home button

Additionally, the group policy setting can set and lock the Home button's location.

#### Passwords

Locking this setting is annoying. I already have a password manager that manages this functionality for me. For those who don't use a password manager, this is fine. 

The result is a constant nag everytime you authenticate with a new site.

I cannot find a reason that an IT admin would choose to *lock* this functionality to save. It seems to be a reasonable suggestion as a default setting. The locking users into nag screens is the problem.
