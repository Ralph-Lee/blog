I listen to a lot of podcasts - probably 25-30 hours a week. Most of those podcasts have sponsors. The hosts typically take a 'break' from the content/discussion, and read some ad copy for a product or service.  The ad usually lasts for 2-3 minutes, and has these Marketing 101 elements:

- the host thanks the sponsor: *"Thanks to ABC for sponsoring"*
