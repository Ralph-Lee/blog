###Tech Partisanship###
It's time to stop with the partisanship in tech. It's a silly and fruitless activity that doesn't get us anywhere. I don't ever want to be engaged in these discussions, and I'll actively disconnect if one arises.

I've observed a few interactions with techy people (enthusiasts, developers, IT pros) recently where the discussion revolved around mobile phones, their operating systems, computer operating systems, cloud services, etc. I hear things like:

>- ewwww, why would you use Android?! It's like a cesspool of malware.
- a Mac? I don't get it, why use a computer with one mouse-button?
- Ruby? Doesn't it let you overwrite a variable with another type? That's insane!
- iPhone just locks you into using a dumb interface with no customization. You can't tweak anything! _Why do you follow the crowd?_
- we need to get more Windows Phones going on around here. It's more modern.
- Windows sucks. Microsoft marketshare is plummeting; M$ is dead in this post-PC era.[^ms]


###Tech Tribalism###
It's useful to understand why tech enthusiasts feel or show allegiance to tech products or their companies. My bottom line on this is that **people like to justify their decisions: both financial and emotional.**

When you make a decision in a personal tech product, that decision involves a financial commitment. That might be an initial outlay of money, or an agreement to pay a large sum spanning multiple years.

When you're choosing to spend a large sum of money, you might go through a few thought processes. You're basically making a **mental investment** in your potential choice.

- is this the right product for me?
- do I have an escape plan if it doesn't work out?
- balance the pros and cons of this choice

By the time the decision-making process is over, you're convinced that this choice is right for you. 

Remember that these companies are large multi-national corporations. They do not care about you; they care about you choosing to buy their next product. Apple is incredibly successful in marketing their products. They use emotion, values, and aspiration to colour your perception and subtly convince you that their product aligns with you. [It's Not a Church, It's Just an Apple Store](http://recode.net/2014/01/02/its-not-a-church-its-just-an-apple-store/). 

Companies love loyal customers, but why do *you* want/need to be a loyal customer? I understand the [basic human need to be a part of a group and find acceptance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belongingness), and that you benefit by sharing experiences, tips and tricks, etc. I also understand that tech companies help encourage you to stay in their product silos by offering features or advantages. This helps reinforce your platform choice. 

Here's where I think things go sideways in the tech geek: they're predisposed to defending their investment, and now vindicated in their choice, as they've gained more benefits in that choice.

The subtle point: all platforms are evolving, and all users within those platforms are benefiting (more or less) at the same rate. 

###Try All Slices.###
A well rounded tech worker stays on top of technology. Some even consider it their job. When a new technology comes on the scene, you should **take the benefit by trying it**. 

Case in point: I purchased a Mac a while back. I'm a Windows developer, and last touch Macintosh in ~1991. They're different environments, and that's a good thing. Why?

- I wanted to see and learn another large computing environment. 
- I kept hearing its users' excitement.
- iOS development was exclusive to OS X.
- I love learning. This change showed me new applications, quirks, and cultures.

It's your job to know what's out there, and to choose the right/best tool for the job. So your job is personal computing? Yes, choose what fits your needs and what works for you. Realize that other people are different.

###Continually Evaluate###

Does your phone look too 

As a technology user/buyer/consumer: you should have an opinion. All these products are valuable to all different kinds of people who've got all kinds of needs. Look beyond your investment.

Main Points
 
- continually evaluate
- try a slice of each tech
- snark
- opinions
 

[^maybe]: Maybe I'm just around the wrong people.
 tl;dr "don't be a dick" and "respect".
[^ms]: "M$" is another example of partisanship.
