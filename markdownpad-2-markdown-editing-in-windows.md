[Scott Hanselman tweeted about "The Markdown Editor for Windows"](https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/309193260402888705). Solid endorsement.

I downloaded [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com), and loved it. Smooth.

I love that the product allows you to use your own CSS in the live preview.

###Feature Suggestions###

Look, feature clutter sucks. Here's my crazy list of features that probably shouldn't be implemented. :) 

**Saved Snippets**
I'd like to be able to insert a custom snippet of text. Just one :)

**Easier Tables?**
A toolbar icon to quickly insert a table would be handy.

**Ribbon instead of a toolbar?**
 
**Find and Replace All**
Implement a Find and Replace dialog (same as you find in Notepad++ and/or Visual Studio). Optionally find all matching tokens, and replace them with another.

**directory browser**
I'd sometimes like to be able to have a view into a local directory. Click on any given .md file, and it would load into the editor.

**HTML element convert to markdown syntax**
My use-case was that I had a bunch of HTML files that I was converting to markdown. I had `<a href="">` and `<img>` in a whole bunch of files.
What would be nice is the option to right-click on the HTML tag, and have the program convert that to the Markdown equivalent.

**Find in files**
Search a directory of Markdown files for a given string token.
