  <p>After stumbling upon this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/a0z60/its_ok_not_to_write_unit_tests/">outrageous Reddit headline</a>, I almost did a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spit-take">spit-take</a>. Here it was:</p>

      <img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Cashto_blog_entry" border="0" alt="Cashto_blog_entry" src="http://devtxt.com/blog/blogimg/UnitTesting_1098A/Cashto_blog_entry_thumb.png" width="435" height="62" />
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>Thoughts running through my head:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>what the WTF</li>
    <li>this is a joke piece</li>
    <li>it's posted on an MSDN blog? </li>
    <li>further, does this guy work at Microsoft? Cashto? Must be the guy's MS userid.</li>
    <li>Oh, it's *ON*!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I then took 15 minutes to read the article. I was surprised to read a Microsoftie actually advise readers that unit tests are a waste of time, and that they don't add value. Sure, it's the author's opinion, and certainly we all have one. He even took the time to submit his article to Reddit himself. Curious though, that the article was published on his blog on 31-Mar-2009, yet he submitted to Reddit on 4-Nov-2009. The comments, as visible today, start on 4-Nov-2009. Not a popular blog, apparently. Perhaps it was a trolling move to submit to Reddit, I don't know.</p>
  <p>I'm going to write as if the author truly believes the, uhm, opinions he writes in this post. I'll try to follow <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BlogInteresting32WaysToKeepYourBlogFromSucking.aspx">Hanselman's rule on Don't Blog Bile</a> here about the author and this piece, but rather provide counter-points to his arguments against unit tests.</p>
  <p>Reaction</p>
  <p>Uncle Bob handily refutes the main points made. If you've ever heard Bob making the podcast rounds on Hanselminutes (at least 3 Episodes- <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=163">145</a>,150 and <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=168">168</a>.), <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/02/podcast-41/">StackOverflow Podcast #41</a>, and <a href="http://elegantcode.com/2008/09/30/cast-cast-15-uncle-bob-martin/">Elegant Code #15</a>, you know he's an articulate and passionate advocate of writing solid code, literally and figuratively.</p>
  <h2>The Overview</h2>
  <p>Cashto almost tries to comfort and soothe developers into *not* writing unit tests, and rather, to feel OK about it. I was incredulous right on the first paragraph. That's like telling a brake mechanic to not determine whether the caliper alignment went as planned on your vehicle's brake service. Oh, the metaphors may run wild here, folks.</p>
