<!--{PublishedOn:"5/18/2014", Title:"The .NET Community Is Buzzing", Intro:"A small response to a podcaster who was very 'meh' about .NET community."}-->
I was listening to a [podcast episode](http://atp.fm/episodes/65 "timestamp 117:20") this weekend where [one of the hosts](https://twitter.com/caseyliss "Who the hell is Casey?"), a .NET developer, said loosely "I don't *love* the .NET community." 

I was puzzled and kind of recoiled a bit. Today is **the best time** to be a .NET dev since .NET's launch, and the community is buzzing with excitement and positivity. 

I realize it was a quick throwaway comment, so I'm not offended (but mostly confused), and the host didn't explain why he felt that way. Am *I* missing something about the community?

###Here's why I love the .NET community.###

These are mostly a sense of the things I feel, read, and hear around .NET lately.

- during Build 2014, my Twitter feed was overwhelmingly positive messages and thoughts from .NET developers, media types, Microsoft employees.
 
- Scott Hanselman - [he blogs](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/), [he speaks (more community events than corporate)](http://www.hanselman.com/speaking/), [he presents](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/3-602), and [he podcasts](http://hanselminutes.com/).

- the ASP.NET team (uh, well all Microsoft teams) blog, and are on Twitter, and show up to user groups around the world. Contrast that with Apple. They talk to their customers publicly. They [let their customers know what's going on](http://www.asp.net/vnext), what features in frameworks and [new features/functionality of tools are coming](http://vswebessentials.com/), and encourage us to help build them. You can literally make a pull request to ASP.NET and all other kinds of projects like [Web Essentials](https://github.com/madskristensen/WebEssentials2013). They don't wait until their annual summer dev conference, don't force people to win a lottery, all to have a conversation about dev issues.
 
- the [ASP.NET community site](http://www.asp.net/community) features blog posts from the wider community.

- all of the Microsoft engineers and PMs (from DevDiv and other teams) who speak regularly and appear on Channel 9 - people like Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Guthrie, Damien Edwards, Mads Kristensen, Jon Galloway, and more.

- [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com). That's a direct effort by Microsoft to foster community, and it's incredibly useful. Events and regular shows/series. They livestream all their developer and IT events (like Build and TechEd) for free, and all videos from those sessions are available within hours.

- ASP.NET itself is [now OSS 'by default'](http://github.com/aspnet). ASP.NET strives for modernity: the MVC pattern, WebAPI, and Azure taking on all kinds of non-Microsoft items and being a part of other communities. All open source frameworks are welcome when you're building an ASP.NET project. It's just angle brackets and curly braces.

- The community outside Microsoft- [Jon Skeet](http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/), [Eric Lippert](http://ericlippert.com/), [Miguel de Icaza and Mono](http://tirania.org/blog/), [Phil Haack](http://haacked.com), [Troy Hunt](http://troyhunt.com) [Rob Conery](http://www.wekeroad.com/) (Rob [contributes a lot](https://github.com/robconery)), the [.NET Rocks guys](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/), [Herding Code](http://herdingcode.com/), and in user/geek media culture like [Windows Weekly](http://twit.tv/ww). I know I'm missing a lot of important people and points here. [Tell me who/what else should be here as an example of how kick-ass the .NET community is](https://twitter.com/philoushka).

- the entire StackOverflow team and all the work and contributions they have made and shared. 

- Satya Nadella's appoinment as CEO has injected a sense of excitement for the company into the community like never before.
