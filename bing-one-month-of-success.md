  <h2>Bing, You've Done Well.</h2>
  <p> I don't have any problems with Bing. That sounds like a backhanded compliment, but it's definitely meant as a kudo. <a href="http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/090709-160556">For Bing, Dethroning the Big G is a Gargantuan task</a>. </p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://bit.ly/7Ypbk">David Pogue at the New York Times has a great video review of Bing</a>. He talks a lot about the consumer-ish features, which I didn't really pay attention to. Yes, the Ajaxy previews are a great feature. The image searches feel a lot cleaner to me as well. I don't really care for all the text cruft when looking for an image. If I want a 'big'-ish image, I'll choose the size option from the left menu. Still, it's in Bing's interest to give value to the searches that most humans are doing: travel, local and consumer-ish type things.</p>
  <h2>As a Developer...</h2>
  <p>...all I really needed to know is why I was getting <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=Cannot+implicitly+convert+type+%27System.Xml.XmlDocument%27+to+%27System.Xml.XmlNode">'Cannot implicitly convert type 'System.Xml.XmlDocument' to 'System.Xml.XmlNode''</a> when trying to pass XmlDocument back and forth between web services. (hey, I didn't specify XmlNode, but that's what gets auto-generated in your Web Service's  Reference.cs!) Oh look, first result!</p>
  <p>A month ago, I took the <a href="http://devtxt.com/blog/post/Bing-Switchover-One-Month-or-More.aspx">Bing 1 Month Challenge</a>. There were a handful of times that I felt I might be able to do better in Google, and about half those times, I found what I was looking for in Google. The majority of searches though, Bing provided me with the results that I need. Basically it never left me hangin'. Who would have thought that a rebranded, remixed and Ajax'd MSN Search would have turned out so well?</p>
  <p>The guys on the <a href="http://herdingcode.com/">Herding Code Podcast</a> pretty much panned it a month ago on <a href="http://herdingcode.com/?p=186">Herding Code Episode 49</a> . I am much more optimistic for Bing's future. I'll be keeping it as my default search engine.</p>
  <h2>Celebrate Good Times</h2>
  <p>Great job, <a href="mailto:B@Bing Team">@Bing Team</a>! Kudos!</p>
